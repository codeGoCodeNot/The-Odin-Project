      To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element
      anchor  tags can link any kind of resources on the internet like videos, images and 
      pdf files and so on, but for the most part, we will be linking to other HTML docs

      We can use target attribute to specifies where to open the link

      target="_blank" opens the link in a new tab
      target="_self" opens the link in the same tab (default behavior)


      We can also use rel attribute in an anchor tag to specifies the relationship between the current
      page and linked page

      rel="noopener" and rel="noreferrer" are used with target="_blank" for security
      It ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page
      without it, the new page can use JS to manipulate the original page

      rel="nofollow" tells search engines no to follow the link

      Absolute and Relative Links

      Absolute links: links to pages on the other websites on the internet
      made of the following parts: scheme://domain/path

      Relative links: links to other pages within our own website
      do not include the domain  name
